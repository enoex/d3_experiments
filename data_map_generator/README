Data Map Generator
=========================================
This uses D3 to generate world 'data maps' similar to http://xkcd.com/802/
It takes in a data file and will create land masses based on the size of the 
input data

Setup
=========================================
All required dependencies are included in the js/libs folder.  To test this 
application, in terminal run:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

And then point your browser at localhost:8888/

Overview
==========================================
The basic process is:
-Create a treemap to get the center position of each 'continent'
    -Slightly randomzie the continent center point so they look slightly more natural
-Use the force layout with foci points and collison detection to form 'continents' from
'countries' (individual data points), with sizes porportional to their percentage of
the total data
-After the force chart is finshed placing the continents, create a convex hull around
each continent to create a polygon that more or less represents the total area of the
continent
    -When creating the convex hull, pick a bunch of verticies based on each country's 
    center point and radius, placing each vertex at some angle.  The more verticies, the
    more 'jaggged' the border will look
-The next step generated country borders.  At this point we'll use use a similar 
strategy involving convex hulls (problem would be lining up borders since countries are
represented by circles), or most likely:
    -a voronoi diagram with weights to draw the country borders and constrain
    the rendered diagram to each continent.  We can then randomize the line segements
    of the voronoi diagram to create jagged country borders
